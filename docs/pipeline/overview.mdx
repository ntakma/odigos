Odigos sets up an observability pipeline in your Kubernetes cluster to collect, process and export OpenTelemetry data.

The pipeline is composed of the following components:

- **Instrumentations** - code that record OpenTelemetry signals from your application. 
It can be code in your application native programming language or eBPF programs that record OpenTelemetry data from the linux kernel.

- **OpenTelemetry SDK** - a library that runs in each instrumented process. it receives the OpenTelemetry data from instrumentations and export it out of the process boundary.

- **Node Collector** - also refered to as `data-collection collector`. Each node in the cluster runs a single instance of this OpenTelemetry collector (DaemonSet). 
It receives the opentelemetry data from the OpenTelemetry SDKs, process it, and export it to the next component in the pipeline.

- **Cluster Gateway Collector** - a collector that runs as a k8s Deployment. It receives the opentelemetry data from the Node Collectors, process it, and export it to the next component in the pipeline.
