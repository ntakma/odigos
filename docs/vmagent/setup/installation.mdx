<Info> Odigos VM Agent is currently available with the Odigos Pro plan. Contact us for more info </Info>

1. After [setting up Odigos repositories](/vmagent/setup/preparation), `odigos` package is available through system's package manager:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="APT">
    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install odigos
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="DNF">
    ```shell
    sudo dnf install odigos
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. Add your Odigos Pro license key to the agent configuration file `/etc/odigos-vmagent/service.yaml`:

```shell
on_prem:
  token: "<your_license_key>"
```

3. Configure which systemd services to instrument and where to send telemetry data by editing the agent configuration file `/etc/odigos-vmagent/agent.yaml`. After installation, only `debug` destination is configured. That helps you to validate that Odigos is picking up telemetry on instrumented applications and can be removed once you don't need it. See the [Reference](/vmagent/configuration/reference) for more information.

4. Start the Odigos VM Agent systemd service:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable --now odigos-vmagent
```

Odigos VM Agent is now installed on your system and enabled as a systemd service.
