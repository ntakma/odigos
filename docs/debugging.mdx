Different components of Odigos can be debugged in different ways. This page describes how to debug each component.

## Odiglet

First make sure you have a running installation of Odigos on a local Kind cluster.
From the root of the Odigos repository, run:

```bash
TAG=<your-odigos-version> make debug-odiglet
```

This command will replace the running Odiglet binary and run it in a container on the Kind cluster.
<Note>
The new Odiglet will not start until a debug session is attached to it
</Note>
Now all that left is to attach a remote debugger (using VSCode / GoLand) to `localhost:2345`
